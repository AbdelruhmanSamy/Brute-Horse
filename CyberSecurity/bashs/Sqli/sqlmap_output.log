The master team sign will sit proudly in your conference room; each time someone uses the word 'I' lights will flash and an alarm will sound. Ear piercing sirens that no-one will ever want to hear again.\nSmaller units are available to dot around your office building, there won't be anywhere safe for a secret meeting, or plots to overthrow your company. With a control panel at your fingertips, the hidden cameras will swiftly pinpoint the culprits, and you will able to talk to them directly through the units.\nOur motto, 'teamwork makes dreams work', says it all.

Here at Planet Love, we are taking this quest very seriously. Let us introduce the first eco, single-use, boat.\nThe Eco Boat is made entirely from paper and reinforced with a super strength adhesive, which will keep you afloat for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes the adhesive will have dissolved due to the high salt content in the ocean, therefore, it is paramount you time your trip to the second. Fifteen minutes each way is more than enough time to enjoy a romantic sunset or to partake of a light supper.\nIn conjunction with the beach services committee, a number of recycling tubs have been situated in the most popular tourist attractions. After your journey, you will be able to easily fold up the soggy paper and pop it into one of the conveniently positioned receptacles. How many people can say they have enjoyed such a unique experience, and been proactive in saving our beautiful planet at the same time?\nLead the way in leisure activities and join Planet Love today.                                                                                                                                  |
| 3  | Waterproof Tea Bags               | productcatalog/products/29.jpg | 2105  | 3      | Food & Drink                    | 1        | You knew one day this would finally come, and thanks to a small group of tea drinkers it has. We bring you the waterproof tea bag.\nFeedback from the tea drinkers society indicated that more people wanted to save money, and be conscious of the effect discarded tea bags could have on the environment. For generations now these environmentalist scrimpers have been hanging their bags out to dry in order to re-use them at a later time. This is no longer necessary as these tea bags are 100% fully waterproof, they will be ready to use as many times as you like with little input or effort from you.\nThis is welcome news for those teapot users who have been riddled with guilt over the number of bags they use per pot. It is now of no relevance whatsoever how many they use, as they will all come out completely dry and ready to use again.\nYou can imagine these bags are a firm favorite with weak tea drinkers, for those who like a bit of a kick to their cuppa the bags have a handly resealable opening at the top. Just empty out the leaves, let them infuse and then decant back into the waterproof bag. Hey presto, ready to use again another day. Be ahead of the rest, this is an environmentally, and economically sound purchase not to be missed. |

Yes, you can now happily order these healing gems directly from us with express shipping. As you can no longer grow these yourself due to the new restrictions being imposed on the product, indeed the penalty is high should you now attempt to do so, we are proud to be the first company to obtain a license for Sprout More Brain Power.\nAlthough the starting price seems astronomically high, one sprout can be divided into peelable layers. Each layer will enhance your performance at work for approximately two hours. If you find a dull brain moment coming on you can pop in another layer, but must not exceed the stated dose of one sprout per day. As tempting as it might be to do so, as your brain buzzes with award-winning ideas, excessive use can lead to social isolation and stomach pain. So don't delay, improve your prospects with your one a day, and Sprout More Brain Power.                                                                                                                                                                         |
