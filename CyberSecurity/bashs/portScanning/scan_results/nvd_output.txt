VulnID:CVE-2021-44224
Description: A crafted URI sent to httpd configured as a forward proxy (ProxyRequests on) can cause a crash (NULL pointer dereference) or, for configurations mixing forward and reverse proxy declarations, can allow for requests to be directed to a declared Unix Domain Socket endpoint (Server Side Request Forgery). This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.7 up to 2.4.51 (included).

VulnID:CVE-2016-6814
Description: When an application with unsupported Codehaus versions of Groovy from 1.7.0 to 2.4.3, Apache Groovy 2.4.4 to 2.4.7 on classpath uses standard Java serialization mechanisms, e.g. to communicate between servers or to store local data, it was possible for an attacker to bake a special serialized object that will execute code directly when deserialized. All applications which rely on serialization and do not isolate the code which deserializes objects were subject to this vulnerability.

VulnID:CVE-2012-2378
Description: Apache CXF 2.4.5 through 2.4.7, 2.5.1 through 2.5.3, and 2.6.x before 2.6.1, does not properly enforce child policies of a WS-SecurityPolicy 1.1 SupportingToken policy on the client side, which allows remote attackers to bypass the (1) AlgorithmSuite, (2) SignedParts, (3) SignedElements, (4) EncryptedParts, and (5) EncryptedElements policies.
